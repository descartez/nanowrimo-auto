PROMPT: "First the world's rim."

First the world's rim. Then farther. That's what the guide had said. She said she wouldn't go with me, as she feared what lay beyond the rim. I will never understand these primitives. They consider this little basin in the rainforest "the world" and never venture from it. They viewed me with suspicion and fear. It took some doing to get them to talk to me in their strange tongue. Luckily I knew a bit of it to start with, enough to ask where I might find my goal.

It wasn't hard finding the basin. It had been mapped by sattelites since there were sattelites. It was a curiousity at most. The massive, sloping mountain was what drew me to it. There had been evidence of tunnel structures below it.
